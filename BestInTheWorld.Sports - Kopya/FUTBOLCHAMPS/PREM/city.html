                    <p>The 2022/23 Premier League was the 31st season of the Premier League and the 124th season of top-flight English football overall. 
                       Fulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were the three promoted clubs from the 2021/22 EFL Championship, 
                       replacing Burnley, Watford and Norwich City.</p>

                    <p>Following Arsenal's defeat to Nottingham Forest on 20 May, Manchester City officially secured a third consecutive Premier League title with three games to spare, 
                       becoming the second club after local rivals Manchester United to achieve the feat in the Premier League era. 
                       It was their ninth English title overall and their seventh since 1992. 
                       Meanwhile, Arsenal broke the record of spending the longest amount of days, with 248, on top of the league in a top flight season without 
                       winning the title in English top flight history.</p>
                        
                    <p>This season was also the first since 2017/18, and only the fourth Premier League season overall, 
                        where all three promoted teams at the start of the season avoided relegation.
                        This was also the first time since 2014/15 that the team 20th at Christmas (Wolverhampton Wanderers), 
                        managed to avoid relegation.</p>
                        
                    <p>2022/23 season was the highest-scoring 38-game season in Premier League history, with 1,084 goals (with a 2.85 goals per match ratio, the best in the history of Premier League).
                       Erling Haaland broke the Premier League record for most goals scored by a player in one season with 36 goals
                       It was also second Premier League season in a row where over 15 millions fans attended matches and with total of 15,289,340 spectators a new competition record was set.
