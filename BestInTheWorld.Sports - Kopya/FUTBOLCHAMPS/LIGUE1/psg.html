                    <p>The 2022/23 Ligue 1, also known as Ligue 1 Uber Eats for sponsorship reasons, was the 85th season of the Ligue 1, France's premier football competition. 
                        It began on 5 August 2022 and concluded on 3 June 2023.</p>

                    <p>As the 2022 FIFA World Cup began on 20 November, the last round before the break was held on 12/13 November. 
                       The league subsequently resumed on 27 December. Four clubs were relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season as the number of clubs was reduced to 18 starting from the 2023/24 season. 
                       As a result, no play-offs were held at the end of the season, and this was the last season played with 20 teams.</p>
                        
                    <p>Saint-Germain were the defending champions, and they won a record-breaking eleventh title with one match to spare, 
                       following a 1/1 draw against Strasbourg on 27 May.</p>
