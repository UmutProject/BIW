                        The 2022–23 Bundesliga was the 60th season of the Bundesliga, 
                        Germany's premier football competition. It began on 5 August 2022 and concluded on 27 May 2023.
                        Bayern Munich were the ten-time consecutive defending champions and retained their title.
                        Going into the final match-day on 27 May, Borussia Dortmund needed a home win over Mainz 05 to clinch the title,
                        irrespective of Bayern's result. However, they drew 2–2, and Jamal Musiala's late winner against 1. FC Köln 
                        sealed the 11th consecutive Bundesliga for Bayern.[3] This was the first time since the 1999–2000 season that the title was decided on goal difference.
                        Schalke 04 and Hertha BSC were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga.
